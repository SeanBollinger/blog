description: First post of my new blog.
---

This is the first post kicking off my new blog. I'd like to make a post weekly, 
but will likely average a post ever two weeks. My current plan is for each post to 
cover a topic that I decide to learn about. 

## Possible future topics

I have a running short-list of topics I would like to write about. I am currently 
growing in my role on a devops team, so the topics will likely all relate to modern
technologies in the operations world, but I am also trying to improve my development
skills, so topics may stray into interesting coding challenges, or things I learn 
that give me an **A-HA** moment. 

- Coding Challenges
- Containers
- Interesting Cloud solutions
- Projects I work on
- Interesting problems or situations from my job
